[fluid~] - soundfont player for Pure Data based on fluidsynth.

### About:

[fluid~] is an external for Pure Data that loads fluidsynth for a fullblown orchestra. **FluidSynth** is a Real-Time SoundFont Software Synthesizer. See: https://www.fluidsynth.org/

### Licence:

Distributed under the GPLv2+, please check the LICENSE file for details.

#### Building [fluid~] for Pd Vanilla:

First you need to install  **FluidSynth** (https://www.fluidsynth.org/) in your system. Then just run the makefile.

This project relies on the build system called "pd-lib-builder" by Katja Vetter (see: <https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder>). PdLibBuilder tries to find the Pd source directory at several common locations, but when this fails, you have to specify the path yourself using the pdincludepath variable. Example:

<pre>make pdincludepath=~/pd-0.51-4/src/  (for Windows/MinGW add 'pdbinpath=~/pd-0.51-4/bin/)</pre>

* Installing with pdlibbuilder

Go to the pd-else folder and use "objectsdir" to set a relative path for your build, something like:

<pre>make install objectsdir=../fluid-build</pre>

Then move it to your preferred install folder for Pd and add it to the path.

Cross compiling is also possible with something like this

<pre>make CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc target.arch=arm7l install objectsdir=../</pre>
