[fluid~] - soundfont player for Pure Data based on fluidsynth.

### About:

[fluid~] is an external for Pure Data that loads fluidsynth for a fullblown orchestra. **FluidSynth** is a Real-Time SoundFont Software Synthesizer. See: https://www.fluidsynth.org/

#### Building [fluid~] for Pd Vanilla:

First you need to install  **FluidSynth** (https://www.fluidsynth.org/) in your system. Then just run the makefile.

This project relies on the build system called "pd-lib-builder" by Katja Vetter (see: <https://github.com/pure-data/pd-lib-builder>). PdLibBuilder tries to find the Pd source directory at several common locations, but when this fails, you have to specify the path yourself using the pdincludepath variable. Example:

<pre>make pdincludepath=~/pd-0.51-4/src/  (for Windows/MinGW add 'pdbinpath=~/pd-0.51-4/bin/)</pre>

* Installing with pdlibbuilder

Go to the pd-else folder and use "objectsdir" to set a relative path for your build, something like:

<pre>make install objectsdir=../fluid-build</pre>

Then move it to your preferred install folder for Pd and add it to the path.

Cross compiling is also possible with something like this

<pre>make CC=arm-linux-gnueabihf-gcc target.arch=arm7l install objectsdir=../</pre>

#### Windows compiling

Download the 32bit and 64bit packages of **FluidSynth** from:
https://github.com/FluidSynth/fluidsynth/releases/tag/v2.1.6
and extract the pkgs accordingly to the `win32` or `win64` folders.

Then you can do with MinGW: 

`make install`

or specify more options with:

`make PDDIR=<path/to/pd directory> PDLIBDIR=<path/to/output> install`

##### if you are Cross-compiling from Linux:

Download and extract the above mentioned **FluidSynth** packages and do:

for 64bit

`make PLATFORM=x86_64-w64-mingw32 PDDIR=<path/to/win64-pd> PDLIBDIR=./out64 install`

or for 32bit:

`make PLATFORM=i686-w64-mingw32 PDDIR=<path/to/win32-pd> PDLIBDIR=./out32 install`
